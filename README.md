# FINAL TEST OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 2021

The project consists in the implementations of the [Master of Renaissance] board game through a distributed system, consisting of a _Server_ and many _Clients_ that can connect to it via the network.
You can connect with the Client via command line (__CLI__) or graphical interface (__GUI__).
